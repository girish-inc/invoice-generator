# Product Specification Document: MERN Stack PDF Generator

## Purpose
This project is for an assignment to show I can build a full-stack web app using the MERN stack. The goal is to create an Invoice Generator where users can log in, add products, and download a PDF invoice. It’s based on a Figma design I got, and I want it to look exactly like that. I started this on Aug 20, 2025, and it’s my chance to impress recruiters!

## Features
### 1. Login Page
- **What It Does**: Users enter email and password to log in.
- **How It Works**: Checks email with a regex (something like @ and .), shows success or error messages. If it works, goes to Add Products page.
- **Design**: Centered form, blue login button (#1E3A8A), matches Figma.
- **Note**: “// Took me a bit to get the validation right!”

### 2. Registration Page
- **What It Does**: Users sign up with name, email, and password.
- **How It Works**: Validates email with regex, saves to database, then sends to Login page.
- **Design**: Simple form, matches Figma layout.
- **Note**: “// Struggled with redirect but fixed it!”

### 3. Add Product Page
- **What It Does**: Users add products with Name, Quantity, and Rate.
- **How It Works**: Calculates Total (Qty * Rate) and GST (18%), lets users add multiple products, has a “Next” button to PDF page.
- **Design**: Green “+ Add” button (#10B981), blue “Next” button, Figma exact.
- **Note**: “// Had to double-check the math here!”

### 4. Generate PDF Page
- **What It Does**: Generates and downloads a PDF invoice.
- **How It Works**: Sends product data to backend, saves to database with date, uses Puppeteer to create PDF from Figma sample, offers download.
- **Design**: Shows product list, blue download button, matches Figma PDF.
- **Note**: “// PDF took some time to match the design!”

## How It Should Work
- **Flow**: Start at Login, register if new, add products, generate PDF.
- **Tech**: React frontend, Node.js backend, MongoDB, Redux for state, TanStack Query for API, Tailwind/Shadcn for styling, Puppeteer for PDF.
- **Security**: JWT for login, basic validation on forms.
- **Scalability**: Simple now, but I can add more features later like more fields.
- **Note**: “// Kept it basic to avoid bugs, might add tests later!”

## Testing Plan
- Test login with wrong email, check error message.
- Add 3 products, verify Total and GST.
- Generate PDF, ensure it looks like Figma.
- Check on mobile and desktop.
- **Note**: “// Planning to test step by step as I build!”

## Additional Notes
- Must match Figma (https://www.figma.com/design/rL5i4YDDb25dhyG2426hEM/Levitation---Assignment-Invoice-Task?node-id=447-151&t=m4WjTYPzyc8EUeh-0) pixel-perfect.
- Deploy on Vercel (frontend) and Cyclic (backend), share GitHub link.
- **Note**: “// Excited to see how Trae handles this doc!”
